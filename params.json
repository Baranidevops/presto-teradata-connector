  "body": "### About the initiative.\r\n#### What is Presto?\r\n[Presto](https://prestodb.io) is an open source distributed SQL query engine for running interactive analytic queries against data sources of all sizes ranging from gigabytes to petabytes. Among its features, it enables you to connect to other databases using some connector, in order to perform queries and joins over several sources.\r\n\r\n#### What problem do we solve?\r\nSome databases require special license agreements in order to use their drivers, so there are many connectors that cannot be merged into Presto. Despite cannot be merged into Presto, we can provide a single place where to register those projects, so that they reach visibility and enhance collaboration within Presto community.\r\n\r\nOur objectives are to provide:\r\n* a web page where developed connectors are listed and can be downloaded\r\n* a template project with instructions, to reduce time for development of new projects\r\n* a groupId and pom.xml snippets, so that connectors can be released and grouped at Maven Central with minimum effort\r\n\r\n\r\n### Presto Database connectors\r\n|Supported database|Project SCM|Download link|\r\n| ---------------- | --------- | ----------- |\r\n|[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/)|[Presto-Oracle Connector](https://github.com/marcelopaesrech/presto-oracle)| |\r\n|[Teradata](http://www.teradata.com/)|[Presto-Teradata Connector](https://github.com/jmrozanec/teradata-presto-connector)| |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nIf you have some suggestions, questions to ask or a connector to register, please reach us at our [Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/jmrozanec/presto-connectors)",
